   This is a work in progress, and should not be used by anyone at this stage. The 
   current LePHARE code is to be found at `https://gitlab.lam.fr/Galaxies/LEPHARE

LePHARE (PHotometric Analysis for Redshift Estimate) is a Python package built on 
a complete rewrite in C++ of the Fortran code LePhare. LePHARE computes photometric 
redshifts and physical parameters by fitting spectral energy distributions (SED) 
to a dataset of photometric fluxes or apparent magnitudes.
