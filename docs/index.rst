LePHARE (PHotometric Analysis for Redshift Estimation)

Since 1999 LePHARE has been a code for computing photometric redshifts and 
physical parameters by fitting spectral energy distributions (SED) to a dataset 
of photometric fluxes or apparent magnitudes. 
LePHARE was originally written in fortran (Arnout et al. 1999; Ilbert et al. 2006). 
It has been completely rewritten in C++ with a Python interface with a larger team of developpers including
J. Cohen-Tanugi and R. Shirley.

.. note::

   This is the official version of LePHARE in C++/Python. It is in active development. The 
   deprecated version can be found `here <https://gitlab.lam.fr/Galaxies/LEPHARE>`_ 
   in case you have legacy code that depends on it.
