Since 1999 LePHARE has been a code for computing photometric redshifts and 
physical parameters by fitting spectral energy distributions (SED) to a dataset 
of photometric fluxes or apparent magnitudes. 
LePHARE was originally written in fortran (Arnout et al. 1999; Ilbert et al. 2006). 
It has been completely rewritten in C++ with a Python interface.
