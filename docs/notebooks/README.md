# Example notebooks

This repository contains a number of notebooks designed to introduce key aspects of the Python interface to lephare. 
Here is a biref outline of each notebook and its purpose:

- [intro.ipynb](intro.ipynb) A very simple deomstration of the basic cosmology classes.
- [example_full_run.ipynb](example_full_run.ipynb) This is an example of how to conduct a full photomoetric redshift run over an input catalogue. All intermediate stages are performed.
- [Buildinf_list_of_onesources.ipynb](Buildinf_list_of_onesources.ipynb) This notebook creates a list of sources with similar photometric data which can be looped over to compute photometric redshift estimates.
- [Example_of_usage_of_magSvc.ipynb](Example_of_usage_of_magSvc.ipynb) This notebook demonstrates the magSvc class which can return magnitudes for a given SED template under given conditions.
- [Testing_fit_of_one_object_of_the_catalogue.ipynb](Testing_fit_of_one_object_of_the_catalogue.ipynb) Demonstrating a simple fit and plotting functions. TODO: Fix running!
- [examples.ipynb](examples.ipynb) Demonstrates some features of the intermediate binary files created during a run. TODO: Fix running!
