LePHARE is a code for estimation of galaxy physical parameters and redshift, based on template fitting. It is a complete rewrite in C++ of the [Fortran code](https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/~arnouts/LEPHARE), with python binding and extension using [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11).

The code documentation, including how to install it and to get started, can be found [here](https://lephare.readthedocs.io/).

**IMPORTANT!** The current repository is under development. If you wish to use LePHARE for science work, please download it from the [currently stable repository](https://gitlab.lam.fr/Galaxies/LEPHARE/).

# Request and help

If you need help with the code, or if you have features requests, please use the github issue system to let us know about it
