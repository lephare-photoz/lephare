LePHARE is a code for estimating galaxy redshifts and physical parameters using template fitting. It is a complete rewrite in C++ of the [Fortran code](https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/~arnouts/LEPHARE), with python binding and extension using [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11).

The code documentation, including how to install it and to get started, can be found [here](https://lephare.readthedocs.io/).

**IMPORTANT!** The current repository is under development. If you wish to use LePHARE for science work, please download it from the [currently stable repository](https://gitlab.lam.fr/Galaxies/LEPHARE/).

# Contributors

LePHARE was originally developped in Fortran by [Stéphane Arnouts](https://people.lam.fr/arnouts.stephane/) and [Olivier Ilbert](https://people.lam.fr/ilbert.olivier/).

The C++ and python rewriting of the code is the work of Olivier Ilbert, [Johann Cohen-Tanugi](https://github.com/johannct), and [Raphael Shirley](http://raphaelshirley.co.uk/).

Other contributors include:
Iary Davidzon, Mara Salvato (MPE), Cédric Dubois (LAM), and Maria Petkova.

We acknowledge fruitful discussions with
Emeric Le Floc'h (CEA), Léo Michel-Dansac (LAM), Jean-Charles Lambert (LAM).
